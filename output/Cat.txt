2020-10-29 16:11:34 : Joint pain at 23 years old? : theoatpie123 : https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/jkcyd5/joint_pain_at_23_years_old/

Hi, I'm a 23 year old female and just wanted some opinions. About three or so weeks ago I started having moderate pain in my right foot where I had broken it around 2011, but then the pain started to spread more. I had originally fractured my fourth metatarsal growth plate and my fifth metatarsal bone, but the pain has begun to spread more upward of my foot and to my ankle. I did have surgery on my right foot in 2014 to remove an extra navicular bone (I have this extra bone in my left foot as well, but without much complication). This past week my left foot has started to hurt as well. Now the joint soreness and pain has spread to other joints (mainly my knees and my hand/wrist). I was told by podiatrists previously that I would end up with arthritis at some point in my feet, but now I'm worried that something else is causing all of this pain. I had scheduled an appointment with a podiatrist for next week for my right foot pain, but now that the pain is spreading I'm unsure if I should see a different doctor. I also have a bump on the top of my right foot at the base of my fifth metatarsal bone towards my ankle, it's rather small but it has been there for a long time. The pain in my fingers and wrist isn't very severe, if anything it feels more like a minor throbbing/burning sensation that is just super annoying but tolerable. Any thoughts on if I should just see the podiatrist and see what they say or if I should try going to a primary care doctor?

Hello everyone! My name is Rob, I'm the founder of Qualify For Solar, we are a small tech startup who's aim is to revolutionize the way customers and renewable energy providers engage.

We believe that the current industry standards are not transparent, and rely on shady marketing tactics.

So we are set out to change that by introducing free, up-front, 100% transparent tools and information to help consumers make better informed decisions, without accidentally selling their information to marketers and regretting the decision to "learn more about solar" as is often the case in this industry.

Feel free to ask me any personal questions you have and I'll happily respond to them as soon as possible.

In the meantime, check out Google's free service here: [https://www.google.com/get/sunroof](https://www.google.com/get/sunroof)

You simply type the address you want to see, and if they've covered that area with their heat signatures yet, then you'll be able to visualize it as well as receive a rough estimate on projected savings.

It is not entirely accurate and still I've seen mistakes on it, but it is a good tool to get started when you're trying to decide about whether solar is a good fit for your home or property.

I simply want to remove the barriers and make it easier for customers to achieve this. We are working with a small team to develop software and new integrative technologies that will definitely make it more mainstream and help connect investors, consumers, companies, and the public sectors alike.

Thanks for taking an interest in renewable energy! The future of our planet relies on our education and action!

For the uninitiated, DC's Act of God was a brief series where everyone's powers - regardless of origin - simply shut off.  Alien biology, magical prowess, radiation, Atlantean physiology, whatever; if you were not a baseline human, you were immediately made one.  The only heroes left unscathed were those that utilized technology and training in their crimefighting (read: only a certain pointy-eared Gothamite could still operate)

If this same event were to happen with Marvel characters - again, regardless of origin - how would things play out?

I went to essence yesterday and was denied access because my medcard was from out of state, they tried to confiscate my nonresident medical declaration saying, “who gave you this, your not allowed to have this” (I got it from the grove dispensary after making a purchase earlier that morning), I went over to Sahara wellness and had no issues whatsoever. Has anyone else every experienced this? It blows my mind that a dispensary with such a high repertoire is so out of touch with the reciprocity laws of their state

Me and a few friends are going ghost hunting tomorrow for a bit of a Halloween spook, going to a supposedly haunted location where a soldier was killed, a husband burned his wife alive and someone also killed themselves on the property where they were also buried, as someone who killed themselves weren't allowed to be buried in a graveyard at the time. It's a pretty old house, people have reported seeing someone in the trees beside it, and stones being thrown at people. One of the rooms remained locked presumably the room where the person commited suicide, a few paranormal investigators have visited the location. It is quite far away from the main road and requires a long walk. What should we do to maintain our safety and try to invoke some sort of activity?

Hello guys,

[https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/hb5xkb/denied\_for\_chase\_freedom\_fico\_763\_and\_75k\_income/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/hb5xkb/denied_for_chase_freedom_fico_763_and_75k_income/)

This is my previous post. Basically Chase wanted to see income verification for my first Chase card and I got approved later (Freedom).

I applied for Freedom Flex the other day, 4 months after getting the first card. However, it showed me the classic "We'll send mail" response. So I called recon and they are asking for income verification again? I thought 4 months would be enough record for them to believe me and I already provided income verification 4 months ago so it would be good but guess not. 

It's also super annoying that they only accept the verification via mail or fax... I don't have printer because who needs one these days? I'm literally going through extra steps for each card from Chase and I'm not sure if that's all worth it as I am planning to get the Freedom Unlimited and Sapphire down the road. Guess they will trust me by then? I'm just thinking about hoping onto Amex after this (or do they do the same thing??).

2020-10-29 16:11:51 : Side by side: Building sideboard on Penny Dreadful : Takeoutree : https://www.reddit.com/r/PennyDreadfulMTG/comments/jkcykv/side_by_side_building_sideboard_on_penny_dreadful/

[Original article.](https://mtg.cardsrealm.com/articles/side-by-side:-construindo-sideboard-no-penny-dreadful)

# In this week's article we will explore tips and various pieces for a good sideboard on Penny Dreadful, in addition to that summary and the decklists of the week.  

  
Ending the 4th weekend of season 18, with the next 10 weeks still to come (quantity expected for the next rotation), let's talk in today's article about a very important topic that can define matches, the sideboard.  If you don't like to build a deck from scratch, or maybe you even like to create but you don't think you have much experience, to help you, I bring here the most used cards on the decks that are working, the proportions and also some ideas that can be used to generate more value from your post side strategy. 

Before starting talking about the cards, it is important to reinforce that a good side is one that can deal with several strategies effectively. Remember that you will normally exchange 4 to 7 cards between games, which are several copies of the same card, exchanging only 1 card will not make you draw exactly this card in the middle of 60 during the entire game. Maybe that's why, many of the decks that made top1 have more focused and less diversified sideboards (used 2 to 3 sets of 4 cards to have a post side consistency) this I think is the &gt;!first tip: !&lt;**focus your side, put only 1 card for dealing with each problem will not be effective.**

Exploring how the most used cards are, below you will see the table with the top 100 most used cards so far in the tournaments, and right away we see **Tormod's Crypt**, without cost to play, being able to come in any color to combat decks that use resources from record as Dredge, Reanimate Turno 1 win and even Cycling (used in the latter to disable **Zenith Flare**). It appeared in 67% of the lists and in 65% of the top1 decks, usually 2 to 4 copies. Another good option to deal with the bass that appears in the top 10 is the **Nihil Spellbomb**, for the option to draw for just 1 cost when popping it, there are lists using the main deck. 

[Top 100 cards most used, only tournaments in Season 18, without basic lands.](https://preview.redd.it/7m6vhufxz1w51.png?width=969&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5ad6caf9a714405314e29184665631f4cd36916)

As a great combo blocker, **Deafening Silence** is widely used from 2 to 3 copies on the sides as well as the **Ethersworn Canonist** who most of the time already goes from the main deck. Another factor that removes the deck combos from the domain in the format were the possibilities of removing the pieces still on the deck such as **Cranial Extraction**, **Memoricide**, **Slaughter Games** and **Stain the Mind**. 

Going back to talking about Grave hate, we have some possibilities like **Tymaret, Chosen from Death** and **Cling to Dust** that can play up to the main. Another one that appears most often, **Dryad Militant** is a good option to use on White Winnie decks or that have green as well. Here I take the opportunity to bring the &gt;!second tip:!&lt; **if there are cards that you can use the most volatile form in your main deck strategy, explore this, Cling to Dust for example, it is less of a grave hate side that can go to the main, you can gain 3 life (great against aggros) or in the worst case you buy a card (note: you still have the Escape option).**

Another need for sideboard use this season is cards that break artifacts and / or enchantments. With several Affinitys working, every sideboard carries 2 to 4 hate of artifacts and enchantments, which can be one-off or global depending on your deck strategy. Among the most common and that can be used in more than one option are **Feed the Swarm**, **Return to Nature** and **Fracturing Gust**. In the line of artifact removal, we have: **Smash to Smithereens, Vandalblast, shenanigans,** and being global: **Granulate, Creeping Corrosion, Purify**.

This season we had the possibility to experience a very fast speed in the game, including, as we will see below, the archetype that has won more times and with more decks in the current goal, the Aggros have an Achilles heel that thanks to the gods, we obtained some low cost global removals: In red we have **Pyroclasm** and **Slagstorm**, in White, perhaps the most effective global removal of the format, **Day of Judgment.** In black some good removals are also strong like **Yahenni's Expertise**, **Drown in Sorrow**, **Ritual of Soot** and **Consume the Meek**.

![img](obliovdt22w51 " 
S18 archetypes, counting only tournaments up to 10/29")

As planeswalkers appearing on the side, we have **Dovin, Hand of Control**, **Teyo, the Shieldmage** and **Gideon Jura**, all focused on delaying or protecting until the development of the main strategy. &gt;!Third tip!&lt;: **Do not leave your main strategy to use side, there are decks like Merfolks that do not use serious hate for example because besides the deck being extremely fast, if a reanimate wants to make fun there are cost 1 bounces and cost 1 counters too.** 

And this 3rd tip brings a very interesting question, do not think about how to hinder the opponent, but how you get an advantage while developing your strategy. Examples: In a Burn deck the idea is to use direct damage on the opponent to kill him, if the player puts a lot of creatures you can end up dying faster or creatures with lifelink will also make you have problems, in this case **Satyr Firedancer** is a good choice of side, while you continue to deal direct damage, removing opponent creatures. Still in the red, I've seen decks using **Dragon's Claw** against mirrors because they can come to life by themselves and by the opponent's magic. 

Little explored ideas: Personally I like to test different things and some things that I managed to generate a lot of value and I don't see much used, were **Guerrilla Tactics** in a burn, since one of the options when someone takes the front is to use disposal to remove the resources. **Lightning Rift** on decks that use red when facing cyclings to use the opponent's resources against him. And lastly, my current side against cyclings and even some deck combos: **Uba Mask**, as the card will be exiled, it cannot be cycled. 

Well, in general, I believe that Penny ends up having a hard time creating a unique side, the format is not as static as others, which makes it even fun in my opinion. These are the most used cards, but there are countless others that are available. For this season I always follow this sideboard ratio and adjust for my deck strategy: 

* 3 to 4 cards to deal with Graveyard, removal. 
* 2 removal of artifacts and enchantments.
* 2 to 4 combos break.
* 2 to 3 creature removals and / or boardwipe.
* 3 or 4 life gain. 

Always remembering that there are cards that meet more than one of these options, and always respecting the game line of your deck. As a &gt;!fourth tip!&lt; **what helps me a lot is to do reverse engineering:** I usually get the decks that I have the most difficulty winning and use them in some test matches. Playing with the deck can you see where the callus grips, what are the difficulties, which loss of resource affects the most? This helps me both in choosing when building the side and when starting to choose which cards will come in and which will come out between games. 

To conclude with an aid in adapting the side, accompanied there as it was in the last week, that the decks are giving more work to be fought. 

\--- SUMMARY METAGAME OF THE WEEK ---

With a smaller participation of the players this weekend, we saw a dominance of the colors Izzet, with the Affinity piloted by the player BR ravage.pe that took 3 top1 and Izzet Drakes from Honourbound84 taking 1 top1 and 1 top2 added 4 of the 6 champions of this weekend. Another deck that appeared a lot was also the Reanimate turn 1 win appearing 4 times at the top. But in general the top8 were well sprayed, with few RDWs and Burns, Merfolks piloted by BR Shadowater0 made top1 again just like a UB Storm. Dredge, Mono Blue delver, esper control and Rakdos Aristrocatas appeared twice each:

I would really like to begin working my way into the a chase trifecta and would like to begin with the chase freedom flex due to the 5% revolving categories that I believe fits my wallet. That said, I have been doing some research and found that some people have suggested creating a checking or savings account with chase would help in the application process.

2020-10-29 16:12:03 : My Job is to Guide Others to the Afterlife : bstant7 : https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/jkcyp2/my_job_is_to_guide_others_to_the_afterlife/

 I guess I’ll start by saying hi. I haven’t really communicated with multiple people in a long time so I’m a little unsure how to go about it, but my name’s Dux and as the title suggests I’m what’s called a Reaper. There’s two tiers of reapers, one is the one most of you may be familiar with, the traditional “Grim Reaper”, where a soul dies and the reaper comes in to ferry it to Heaven or Hell and the second one, the one I am, is the lower tier. Essentially I live my life as a human would, but every couple weeks I have to guide a soul who was taken before their time. I’ll explain what this means more in a bit, but basically some are chosen to meet their eternity early. Basically a soul can become a reaper after they die and repent. I myself died right near the turn of the 20th century and have been at this for about a hundred years now. After two hundred I’ll get bumped up to Tier 2 and if you’re confused by my less than traditional name, Reaper’s get to choose their own name after their first ferry and I chose Dux which means Leader. I thought it was fitting, but I digress.

Back to the point. In Tier 1 the souls aren’t dead yet, but they have the choice to face a series of trials to get into Heaven or Hell. The reason I’m writing this post is because of my last ferry. In my hundred years of ferrying I’ve only had about 3 dozen souls, like I said this is a very very rare opportunity for souls, but this one was my youngest and something about it has stuck with me and I needed for someone to read this so that they know what’s possible and maybe if you’re one of the “lucky” chosen then you can be prepared or you at the very least know to turn back.

Abraham had just turned 14. I don’t know why he was chosen so early. If I had it my way this wouldn’t even be an option, but I don’t have a choice. I was placed with Abe, so the calling had to begin. It starts with dreams a few weeks before it’s time. The soul will start hearing their reaper’s voice calling out to them. It’s faint and really not noticeable at first when they’re awake, but it drowns out their dreams for days. Eventually their mind can make sense of the Enochian and that’s when it takes a turn.

As soon as they make the translation the gentle calls of their name turn into sounds of Hell and their dreams are overtaken by what could possibly await them. I always try to yell over the screams a simple mantra, “The path to Darkness is paved with gold, but Paradise lies beyond pain” but I really don’t know if it ever makes it through and the fact that before Abe I only had four people make it to Heaven makes me think it doesn’t.

During this time a reaper starts to, connect, with their soul. Essentially we start to feel what they’re feeling. Pain, Joy, Fear, really whatever they feel I start to feel. This helps us sympathize further and, allegedly, this is supposed to help more souls make it to Heaven, but again 4 have, so I think it’s bullshit. Anyway, this will go on for weeks until the soul is finally ready. By ready I mean they can barely sleep or function in general out of fear from the nightmares they’re experiencing and the voices they’re hearing throughout the day now. I hate that it comes to that, but eventually we can bring them to the path. 

Abe went to sleep that last night with peace. I could feel his bliss as he was finally able to rest his head on his pillow and listen to nothing but silence. As soon as they fall asleep I usually summon them, but I let Abe rest. It broke my heart that I had to bring him and I really wanted him to enjoy the last bit of peace that he ever might experience.

Eventually I relented and brought him to The Path. I stood at the entrance to the path as Abe stood with his back to me. I could instantly feel his fear more intense than ever. I felt fear that I hadn’t ever experienced from a soul. He shivered and shook violently from the freezing cold around us and his panic at standing alone in the pitch black. I looked at my own hands and realized I had started slightly shaking as well which was odd. I looked back at him with curiosity and snapped my fingers. Suddenly the path fully opened and the clearing we were standing in was bathed in light and warmth. I watched his shoulders relax and immediately felt his fear diminish. It wasn’t gone, but it was lessened for the time being. I tried to hold back a smile, but I couldn’t.

As he turned I could feel his joy rise and then the fear was back like never before. This was a normal step. Reapers take on the form of whatever soul they’re in charge of at the time, again this is supposed to make the transition easier or something, but I know when I saw my reaper it was the most terrifying moment of my life or afterlife. I kept the smile on my face to try and project a feeling of calm to the boy, but the connection’s only one way.

I beckoned for him to join me, but he didn’t move. Understandable. The fear I was feeling through Abe made my smile waver, but I fought through it as he started floated towards me. This is something we have to do sometimes and if any of you ever experience this it’s nothing to be ashamed of. This is a scary moment and sometimes your legs just don’t want to work. The way he kept eye contact with me while he floated was new though and a little off putting. I could feel that even with his fear he was a strong kid and was trying to maintain that on the outside, ready for anything I was about to throw at him. It gave me fleeting confidence in that moment. He had no idea what was waiting.

When Abe was about 3 feet from me he was lowered back to the ground. I gave him a second to run through the gambit of emotions that were normal for the situation and felt each one with him. He pushed right through disbelief and horror and settled almost immediately on dread. Again my smile fell momentarily as I shook from the strength of what he was feeling. I shook it off and cleared my throat, ““Hello Abraham. My name is Dux. I have the honor of being your guide on the final path. You may ask me anything you like.”

Abraham didn’t move. I could feel the tears coming before I saw them, “F...final path?” He stammered. I nodded slowly. “I’m only 14.”

I tried to maintain a cheery look, but had to blink my eyes to maintain composure. “Yes, you haven’t lived a long life, but some are given early release from the mortal plane to gain the chance to live forever in Paradise. Congratulations.” I know it sounds so stupid and cliche, but we basically have a script. As expected, Abe stood in silence so I cleared my throat again and continued, “I’m what’s called a reaper. I was once human and I wasn’t given this same opportunity so you truly are getting something special.” With that I could actually manage a real smile. Abe’s spirits lifted for a second when he heard he was special and that lifted the weight sitting on me for a moment.

That moment crumbled as Abe fell to his knees in tears. “But I don’t want to go. I’m only 14.” I reached a shaking hand out to touch his shoulder, but Abe pulled away, “I don’t want to go.”

I couldn’t figure out what was wrong with me. Most of my souls are middle aged or older and I can suppress their feelings easily. The one time I needed to maintain composure to calm this child and I couldn’t.

I took my time to collect myself. “I understand. Again I wasn’t given this opportunity I just died young and became a reaper to save myself from the darkness. This is a way for you to avoid the darkness.”

Abe sniffed and tried to compose himself. “If I have to do this, what do I have to do.” I could feel that strength bubble to the surface again. His confidence was at war with his fear and an involuntary smile spread across my face.

“It’s not going to be easy,” I began, “but you’ll endure a series of tests and depending on how you face them you will be placed in Paradise or be thrown to the darkness. After each test you can continue or leave the choice is yours.”

Abe took a couple breaths before responding, “What kind of tests?”

I sighed, “They get progressively worse. I can’t say exactly what they are, but it’s not going to be easy. Like I said, there is an exit after every one.”

I let the words hang in the air and felt him go through emotions so quickly I could barely feel them before the next one was there. “That being said. You can end this right now and go back to your life.” Abe looked up at me with curiosity and confusion. “You pass these trials and you make it to Heaven. If you don’t….you don’t. Or you can take your chance with life and hope everything works out in your favor.”

This new information sent his mind into overdrive. For a young kid he weighed the pros and cons with a level of maturity that most older souls don’t even have. He stood there in external silence for a while. I went to say something else, but he interrupted me, “Let’s fucking go.” He said it with such force that I couldn’t help but smile. This kid was infectious and I think I knew why he was chosen for this. I reached out my hand and after some hesitation led him through the trees behind me.

We walked in silence and I felt him trying to get a hold of his nerves, “What’s the first test?” He finally asked.  

“The first one is relatively easy.” I said while keeping my eyes straight ahead. “This is also the only one I can help you on. Do not look at anyone in this test. If you have to close your eyes, close them, I don’t care, just don’t look anyone in the eyes.”

Abe gulped, almost regretting asking the question, and continued in silence until we came upon a split in the path. “We’ve reached our first decision. Would you like to forgo the tests.” I said gesturing to the left path that had a bright golden glow to it, “Or would you like to endure.” I finished, waving my hand towards the right path that was shrouded in darkness. Faint moans could be heard through the black. Again don’t get on me about the cheese, it’s stuff I have to say.

“Let’s test it.” Abe said after a breath. I smiled, hoping desperately that he could feel me trying to be reassuring. The left path dimmed and we continued to the right. 

I left Abe in the darkness and moved to the end of the trial. I could see and feel everything he endured during each trial and I shook with his nervousness. “Good luck,” I yelled to him as the darkness lifted around him. 

Abe’s head immediately shot towards the sky and at first I could feel confidence start to take over. But then the test actually began. As soon as he took a step the air around him erupted into pained moans. I watched as the figures that I knew to be damned souls swarmed around him aimlessly. They weren’t going to do anything, unless he looked at them, hence my warning. He froze immediately and I could feel the fear start to grab hold. I silently cheered him on and eventually he took a deep breath and started moving again. It took all I had to not start cheering for the kid. I saw him bump off a few of the souls and stop each time consumed by fear. 

“Close your eyes.” I accidentally said out loud. I looked around quickly and then realized I’m always alone during these trials so are there even rules? I wasn’t even sure he heard me until he stopped a final time and closed his eyes. He brought his head down to face forward and I could feel his immediate relief as looking up was beginning to strain his neck. I took a deep breath and started feeling a bit better myself. He shook slightly as the moans grew louder as more souls filtered in from the trees and aimlessly wandered around him. He gulped and put out his hands and began on his way again.

He made his way through at a painfully slow pace, but as long as he made it through the timing didn’t matter. He eventually made it past the mass of bodies and I could feel his fear start to dissolve as the moans most likely were starting to die away the further he went. When he was about 100 yards from the end of the path he stopped. I didn’t know what was going on, but all of a sudden his eyes shot open. My heart dropped as he stared in my direction in confusion. He can’t see me or anything beyond this trial until it’s complete so when he opened his eyes all he saw was darkness at the end. 

I could feel his confusion turn to panic as he started frantically looking around, thankfully just side to side at first, but then to my horror he turned around. He grew completely still and couldn’t even shake from terror when he saw the grotesque, human-ish figures that he had just passed through bumping into each other and slowly moving back and forth. I don’t blame the kid as the naked wrinkly skinned creatures still give me the creeps after all this time. I held my breath and was frozen from his fear as one of the souls met Abe’s eyes.

The moaning stopped and the hoard turned in his direction in unison. Time seemed to freeze as everyone stood motionless. As soon as Abe took a step back the hoard let out horrifying screams and began to stream towards him at an unbelievable pace. To his credit, Abe didn’t let his crippling fear slow him down as he turned and sprinted in my direction with everything he had. I could feel his desperation and looked from him to the hoard that was rapidly gaining ground and back again. I could hear his panting and realized I was panting myself as I started screaming for him to hurry. Fuck the rules. 

The leading souls reached out and barely grazed his shirt as he got about 25 yards from me. I was all but reaching out my hand at this point. A chill went through my body as one of the souls dove and grabbed him around the ankle throwing him forward. His top half of his torso landed out of the trial and he looked up at me with panic, pleading with his eyes even though he was too afraid to speak. I hesitated for a split second too long and the hoard began dragging the child back into the trial. He kicked violently and let out a heart wrenching scream as the skin was starting to get torn from his calves. That was enough for me to reach down and drag the kid the rest of the way. 

As soon as his feet crossed the border everything behind us turned to black and we were left there with him sobbing softly on the ground and me, panting, standing over him. I could feel his pain and it crushed me. No kid should have to go through this. His sobbing slowly faded and I could feel relief start to overtake the desperation and fear he was feeling. 

I knelt down beside him and put my hands on his back. I was able to catch my breath, “I told you not to look at them.” I tried to say something light, but I’m not sure if that was the right thing as he shot around and stared at me.

He didn’t say anything but I knew he was angry. I sighed and helped him to his feet.

“Can I rest for a moment please?” He pleaded with me. 

“I’m sorry, but no. We have a while to go before the next trial and I promise you’ll be feeling better by then.” I was lying and I knew he knew it. He didn’t bother looking at me for a while or saying anything. I didn’t blame him and my own shame started to fight with his pain in my head.

We were almost near the second trial when he finally asked, “What the hell was that?”

I looked at him, but didn’t break stride, “That was the first test. Those were lost souls who refused to repent, but didn’t deserve the darkness. Basically they rot and turn into that. It’s like limbo I guess.” 

“Would that be me if they dragged me back?”

“No that would have been much worse.” I replied shortly. The less I talked it seemed to help me control his emotions that I was feeling so. 

I could feel fear suddenly spike in him and glanced over to see him looking towards the trees that lined the path around us. I knew he was looking at the dark silhouettes that stood in between the trees, but he didn’t ask and again I was trying not to speak as much, so we just kept walking. 

I stopped when we reached another fork in the path. “We have reached our second choice. Would you like to exit, or continue?” I asked, gesturing to both paths respectively. 

Abe didn’t hesitate, “Test.” I smiled proudly. The left path again was thrust into darkness  and Abe moved towards the right.

“Good luck Abraham.” I said before Abe walked into the darkness.

I took my spot at the end of the trial and watched nervously as the darkness lifted around Abe and he was immediately hit with a strong gust of wind forcing him to stagger and brace himself. I felt his fear for a split second, but he quickly regained his confidence as he was able to find his footing and slowly trek forward. Stumbling, I could feel his pain start to lift as the cold air and freezing winds numbed his raw legs.

The further along the path he trudged, the stronger the winds became and eventually he had to lean forward to brace himself. I could feel stabbing pain starting to creep back as the cooling effects of the wind started going in the opposite direction on the rest of his body, stinging his skin and eyes. This is one of the shortest trials, but probably takes the longest and the fact that after about half an hour he was only about 10 feet along was a great testament to that.

Eventually, as they all do, Abe leaned about as far forward as he could and stopped moving. I shook slightly from the cold that he was feeling on his own body, a sensation I hadn’t felt since my own penance. I attempted, pretty unsuccessfully to control my slight shiver. While I was focusing on myself, Abe laid down and started crawling with his eyes closed along the ground. I could feel his agony every time he dug his fingers into the almost frozen dirt. He was going a lot slower than standing, but he was moving at a more consistent pace than before. I felt a quick twinge of fear, but I think he was way too cold to feel or think anything. The winds continued to get stronger until he was about 10 feet away from me and I could see him start to slide backwards along the ground. He furiously flailed his hands in front of him and dug even deeper into the hard ground then before. 

He let out a scream of pain as I could see his fingernails start to lift off of his bloody hands. The progress was much slower and more excruciating, but inch by inch he came to the end. He let out one last defiant roar that sent shivers down my spine and pulled himself the last bit until the path grew dark and he laid on his back at my feet, shivering uncontrollably with his eyes closed. I knelt down next to him and could hear the faintest sobs as a tear forced its way out of his eyelid. My own eyes started to bubble slightly, but I rubbed then and put a hand on his shoulder.

“You’re doing amazing kid.” I tried to sound as reassuring and confident as possible, but my voice wavered a bit as his fear and pain overtook me. Abe opened his eyes and stared blankly at the black starless sky that hung above us. If you didn’t know any better you’d think we were in a bottomless pit with no hope of clawing our way to the surface and I could tell by his stone face still spanked with tears that he was feeling that emptiness and hopelessness.

He didn’t say anything for a long time and I let him sit with this. As his body thawed the pain returned to his legs and hands, but to the kid’s credit he didn’t show it. I could feel his internal agony, but his face was stoic. I looked at the blood streaming from his legs and noticed he was missing a few nails and could do nothing, but sigh. I wanted to pick the kid up and carry him, I wanted to help him along, but he needed to be strong to make it through and that wouldn’t help. 

After some time he looked at me and allowed me to help him to his feet. We moved along much slower than before in silence that was suddenly broken by screaming all around us. Abe surged with fear and looked around as a cold sweat started pouring down his face. “What is that?” he asked almost inaudibly, looking at the many more figures that were now standing in the trees.

I was too transfixed by Abe’s pain to remember the figures at first, but then I snapped out of it. I looked side to side without stopping our progress, “Those are souls that were lost to this particular test. They have to stay here for eternity and watch others try to succeed where they failed. That’s what would’ve happened if those creatures on test one had pulled you back or if you couldn’t make it past the winds. 

The screams were faint right now, but I knew it would get worse as we moved further in the tests. He was shaking in fear looking around us and was too preoccupied to realize we had gotten to the next fork. I didn’t even bother going through my whole thing this time and just nodded to him. 

Abe exhaled sharply. “Test.” he breathed out.

I gave his shoulder a squeeze. “You can make it through this Abraham.” I pulled the kid in and kissed the top of his head. “Good luck.”

As soon as the darkness lifted ice hit Abe’s head without warning. A tremendous hail was pouring down on him from above. He didn’t hesitate this time. As soon the cold from this test numbed his raw legs and nailless fingers and he used that to his advantage. I watched with a tentative smile as Abe waited for the cold to take it’s hold and began to sprint as fast as he could. The hail grew worse as he moved until I knew there was just a wall of white pain in front of him, but he never broke stride and closed his eyes.

The more he ran the more confidence I could feel surge in him, but I couldn’t share the feeling and as soon as a terrible roar cut through the almost deafening sound of hail that confidence was shattered and he stopped in his tracks. His eyes shot open and then back to a squint as he frantically looked around trying to identify the source of the sound, eventually landing on the giant 3-headed creature perched on a throne overlooking the trial. I knew Cerberus wasn’t a threat, but I was hoping he didn’t shake Abe long enough to impede his progress on this trial.

To my relief Abe slowly continued on again without taking his eyes off the motionless figure. His senses were heightened now and the pain from the hail was starting to make it’s way to the surface. Without warning Abe turned back towards me, closed his eyes and sprinted faster than ever. One last roar tore through the air and chased him out, but the path grew dark and Abe stood in front of me, hunched over and panting.

I could feel the stinging on his skin and couldn’t tell if his slight shiver was from the cold or pain, but I put my hand on his back. “That was fast man.” I said with a sense of pride taking over. “Honestly one of the fastest I’ve seen in my time.”

He looked up at me, still trying to catch his breath and wordlessly just gestured for us to move on. This is one of the first times in years I felt genuine joy. This kid was strong. I held him back for a second and looked him in the eyes. “It may not seem like it, but you’re doing really good right now.” I looked for confirmation in his eyes or anything, but I could feel his lack of confidence and it hurt. I bit my lip and sighed. We both looked down and saw the massive collection of welts that joined his torn legs and hands. He started trembling and tearing up as he watched the blood pour down his shins and over his destroyed shoes. I could feel his regret and my stomach began to hurt.

I put my arm around his shoulders and began leading him down the path. I went to say something hopefully reassuring, but he interrupted me, “What the hell is a reaper anyway?”

I was a little taken aback by the question. Not that I don’t get asked, because I do, but I usually get asked much much earlier in the process. “Well the short version is we ferry souls.” He cringed a bit as the screaming began around us. I wasn’t going to continue, but I knew the kid needed a distraction for a second. “When we die some of us are given this option as penance for our sins. We spend a few hundred or thousand years ferrying souls depending on our sins and then go to Heaven.”

He didn’t react to anything I was saying and I knew he didn’t care. I wasn’t feeling anything from him which was new. I think he was trying to numb himself. Smart.

We came up to the next fork and before I even attempted to speak he yelled, “Right!”

I sighed and nodded slowly. I didn’t bother with the good lucks this time and he didn’t look at me, just walked into the darkness.

The darkness lifted and Abe looked curiously at the large boulder that stood in front of him. He was still numbing himself but I could feel curiosity start to peak through. I smirked at the fact that he wasn’t afraid. Even when he saw the tiny goblin like creatures standing around the boulder excitedly jumping around and screeching to themselves the stupid language they speak, he was just curious and nothing else. I saw him flinch in pain as his injuries began to take their toll again. He closed his eyes and hung his head, clenching his fists trying to control himself. 

As he looked down the goblins hopped over and dragged him towards the boulder. They strapped a chain around his waist and excitedly laughed and jumped their way back into the trees. His eyes were still closed and he didn’t move for a while. I was growing more nervous as I felt the pain radiate worse than ever before. 

I gave him a few more minutes, trying to suppress the pain that now surged throughout my body. “Fucking go kid!” I managed to scream.

This seemed to break his trance and his eyes shot open, looking in my direction a few hundred yards away. He stumbled forward until the rope was taut and stopped. He turned towards the boulder and took a few deep breaths, grabbing the chain with both hands. He yanked as hard as he could and the boulder moved a couple inches. “Fuck.” I could hear him mutter, resigned.

This trial wasn’t that hard, but it was grueling. Honestly after this one a lot gave up, if they even made it this far and this is what I feared for Abe. I held my breath, silently cheering for him. Out of nowhere I felt a wave of confidence over take him as he took his time moving the massive stone. I knew he still felt the pain all over his body, but slowly, very slowly he inched forward. He stopped when the pain was too much, but after maybe 10 yards or so his body began to numb and he could continue on. With the pain gone in his legs he could drive forward with more power and moved a bit faster, but after about half a day of pulling I could feel his confidence wavering.

To my disappointment he first sat and then laid down, basically giving up. I was heartbroken. I hung my head and just waited for him inevitably to just pass on. I sat staring at him not knowing what to do besides playing with the dirt in front of me. We sat like that for 20 minutes or so when out of nowhere he sprung to his feet and I could feel fear surge through him. I didn’t know what had prompted this but I was all for it. I jumped up as well and started yelling for him.

He turned his back to me again and pulled and didn’t stop pulling this time. I could feel the strain and watched him dig his heels into the ground and pull with everything he had. He let out a few screams and inched his way towards me. His confidence overtook the fear as he moved closer and closer until after a full day was almost at the end of the trial. I reached across the barrier and my hand started burning painfully. I pulled back surprised. I never tried to help a soul before.

I hesitated and swallowed as his progress had slowed. I took a deep breath and jumped onto the path. The searing pain forced me to let out a scream that startled Abe, who turned to me and jumped back. I screamed again and grabbed his chain. I saw smoke coming from my arms as we both pulled the last few feet and felt immediate relief when we made it to the other side.

This time we both slumped over and panted. I caught my breathe first and my body had already started healing so the burns that had formed on my arms were closing themselves. I let out a little laugh, “I’m not doing that again.” I said with a smile and looked up at him, but he wasn’t looking back.

He looked worse than before and now on top of the crippling pain, I could feel his utter exhaustion. I limped over to him and put a hand on his shoulder. He wasn’t crying, but I knew he wanted to. “If you want to stop, I can carry you.” I bent down and whispered in his ear.

He took a couple more seconds and a sinking feeling began forming in my gut. I wanted him to refuse, but I’ve seen this look before, when a soul is done, they’re done. The longer he took to answer or even look at me the worse I felt. With him responding I went to lift him, but he slapped me away. “I’m not done yet.” He said looking at me with fire and determination that I wasn’t expecting. Another shiver went down my spine and I beamed with pride. 

I grabbed his hand and helped him get fully upright. “You got this kid.” I said pulling him in for an embrace.

His words and eyes gave off confidence and defiance, but I could feel his resignation and fear. I held him for a long time trying my best to let him heal as best I could. We pulled away and began on our way. The screams were louder now than ever and it was pointless to even try talking. It was better at this stage to conserve energy anyway and soon we were to the next fork. 

I didn’t ask or gesture. I didn’t need a response because I knew our journey together was going to continue. Faint splashing could be heard from the dark right path and I saw him hesitantly look at the shining gold path to the left. He took a couple deep breaths and moved to the right, into the darkness.

I took my normal place at the end of the trial and was pleased to see my friend Nuntius standing there waiting for me. “Dux!” he yelled when he saw me and we embraced. “It’s been too long, I’m sorry that we’re meeting again though.”

I sighed and told him I shared his sentiments. When the pleasantries were finished we stared at each other in silent pity for a few moments. “How is yours.” I finally asked.

He sighed, “He’s a good guy of course, they all are. But he doesn’t have the strength, I know,” He let out a deep, sad sigh, “this is his last trial.” 

I clapped a hand on my friend’s shoulder, “I’m so sorry. Thankfully this is your last ferry?”

I saw his lips quiver trying to smile, but it wouldn’t come. “I would’ve liked to end it by bringing another soul to paradise, but take it from an old veteran, watching good people suffer is still part of the penance.”

We touched foreheads and stayed silent for a few moments with our eyes closed before I whispered. “My kid is strong.”

Our eyes opened and I continued, “He’s one of the strongest I’ve had, he’s young, but worthy.” Nuntius weakly smiled and gave me a knowing nod. “I’m truly sorry for this.” 

We put our arms around each other and looked at the trial.

Abe stood on one side of a narrow, decrepit, wooden path sitting about 35 feet above a raging river. On the opposite side of the path stood a man of about 50 who looked to be in worse shape than my Abraham. I looked at Nun and he nodded reluctantly. We turned back and the man looked horrified while I could see and feel Abe’s curiosity as he looked at the tall black waves that almost reached his pier, flinching ever so slightly everytime a skinny, decayed hand reached out looking for anyone to raise them from their fate.

Abe eventually looked back to the man who was still shaking and looking around in fear. Abe did nothing as the man finally looked to him and they both stood there in confusion, neither knowing what to do. Out of seemingly nowhere during their stare there was a large crack of lightning and in each of their hands an old rusty sword and old wooden shield appeared. I felt Nun tense up in my grasp as the two froze in place as a sense of shock overtook Abe and I knew he knew what was going on. 

Nervously he looked up to the man, who was staring at the sword and shield with a mixture of fear and shock. I held my breath as Abe looked from the sword to the man and back and then slowly made his way to the other side of the walkway. The man looked up and saw Abe approaching and lifted his sword, but didn’t move. Abe picked up speed as he ran forward and let out a scream before swinging down so violently that both Nuntius and I jumped back. The man blocked with his shield but was thrown back to the edge of the walkway.

Abe didn’t let up and dropped his shield to use both hands to swing down over and over and over onto the man’s shield. I could see tears filling his eyes and could feel how afraid he was in this moment. The man kicked him in the gut sending the small child flying back and they once again stood staring at each other as the waves below grew higher and higher, starting to soak the moldy, broken boards upon which the two souls sparred. They both let out screams and ran towards each other, swords cocked back ready to strike. Neither were very skilled and simply swung at each other trying desperately to hit something fleshy. 

Abe landed the first blow, stabbing the man in the gut. He let out a small cry of pain, but didn’t let up on the much smaller soul. Swinging overhead relentlessly eventually getting Abe with a good jab to the shoulder. The child screamed and dropped his sword off the edge of the platform into the dark water below as a thick stream of blood started pouring out of him. I winced and closed my eyes and only opened them when I felt my friend’s hand squeeze my shoulder. 

Through watery eyes I watched in terror as the kid fell to his back and started crawling backwards away from the man. I fell to my knees as the tears ran down his face and could barely make out his pleas of mercy over the raging waves. Nun knelt down next to me and embraced me hard. We both knew how hard this was and I know he was not enjoying my misery.

Abe scrambled backwards as quickly as he could as the man slowly followed him and raised his sword above his head,  bringing it down hard onto Abe’s blocking arm, making a clean cut and sending the severed limb tumbling over the edge. Abe and I both let out heart wrenching screams as I completely fell to the ground and he stopped scrambling, holding his severed appendage. The man had tears running down his face and I felt Nuntius lean in close to my ear. “He’s sorry.” 

Abe was rolling in pain as the blood soaked the platform around him. The man hesitated, he was a good man after all, but then raised his sword for one final swipe. As he brought the blade down the waves finally reached the platform and one of the lost souls in the water found what it was looking for as a decaying hand grabbed the man’s ankle and dragged him, screaming in terror into the waters below.

Nuntius and I both sat there, stunned. We had never seen a soul be grabbed. We knew what swam in the Styx, but had never seen them grab another soul. I could still barely stand as Abe now lay writhing in pain, still clutching his severed arm on solid ground. Nuntius let out a breath and looked from Abe and back to me. 

He didn’t say anything and he didn’t have too. I nodded my head as my eyes began to tear. He stood up and began to walk away, “I hope to see you in the next phase my friend.” I called weakly after him.

He turned and smiled to me, nodding before disappearing into the trees.

I weakly crawled over to Abe who was crying silently on the ground as his arm bled. I didn’t say anything at first and laid next to him, not able to take his pain, but just feel it. I wanted to take it. I wanted to take him back and make him go back to his life. It was too late.

I managed to get to my feet and he still didn’t open his eyes or move. All he did was whisper, “Please carry me.” Through tears.

I let out an exasperated sigh and nodded, trying to catch my breath before I reached down and scooped up his body. His blood poured down on me as we trudged along slowly and the screaming souls were silent. I felt tears form in my eyes and for the first time since my own penance they dripped down my face onto the motionless figure that I carried. 

I was shaking as we finally got to the fork for the 6th trial. I went to speak but was stopped by the sobs that I thought were from Abe but realized were coming from me. I began again as my tears soaked my face. “I don’t care that I carried you. You can continue.” I looked down at the young face all but pleading with him to continue onto the Light.  

He looked at me and, coughing up blood, smiled, “No more tests Dux.” I fell to my knees and dropped him to the ground. I sobbed uncontrollably as he struggled to his feet and turned to hug me, “Thank you.”

“I...I’m so sorry Abraham.” was all I could muster as I watched the child slowly walk towards the golden path to the left. 

“The path to Darkness is paved with gold, but Paradise lies beyond pain.” I heard him lightly chant to himself as he moved.

I smiled slightly as he crossed the barrier and I watched and felt as his severed arm grew back and felt all his pain vanish as joy filled his heart. He paused just beyond the barrier and I could feel a surge of fear overtake him. I couldn’t see what he was seeing but he turned back screaming and ran towards me before the darkness consumed him and he was gone.

I… I don’t have a choice, but to continue with the path that I’ve chosen. I don’t have a choice but to try and be a better ferryman to those who decide to take this path. But please, please  if you are given the chance, turn back and live your life, take your chances.

2020-10-29 16:12:18 : What are considered non fast paced jobs that are professional? : Madeline2853 : https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jkcyv8/what_are_considered_non_fast_paced_jobs_that_are/

People suggest, "just apply here, there's a help wanted sign."

Why dont people ever engage in a discussion about the math.

The net income, and how that covers a budget to live on.

I need a certain income to meet my expenses, including housing, car and healthcare.

But I've had people say, "don't worry about what it pays, some money is better than no money."

What if you cant work a 2nd job, but can work 7am to 5pm.

But the job pays $12.00 hour pretax

I was told I have to disregard my finance and masters degrees and that some money is better than no money,  even if it doesnt qualify me for housing and would only cover my car, past due bills, phone, food and medications but not housing.

I want to focus on the math.

$12.00 is $10.00 net

$10/hour = $400 week or $1,600

Healthcare $200/month
Car $300/month plus $100 insurance
$200 gas

$400 food, miscellaneous, hygiene products, laundry, car maintenance 

$65 phone

Need money for:
Housing $
Grad loan which has to be paid $
Medical and dental copayments $
Clothing replacement if necessary $
Credit card balance $125 min month pmt

How much do you need to live on to cover those expenses above?

People say "any job is better than no job."

Okay, how do I meet the above expenses, and still be cheerful and chipper in my work, working calmly and composed, under pressure without showing signs of anxiety or stress.

2020-10-29 16:12:18 : Recommend Me - First New Knife : wtellis2 : https://www.reddit.com/r/chefknives/comments/jkcyv3/recommend_me_first_new_knife/

 Hello all!  After spending a couple of hours delving through this subreddit, I figured it was time to get a recommendation.  I have been using hand-me-down knives for most of my "adult" life (at 26, I still find that term debatable at best), and even though I have taken relatively good care of them, I am on the hunt for a more reliable chef's knife.  I have settled on a western/German knife largely due to a need for the more versatile of the two styles, but also won't be using it as a cleaver (will be using an older knife and/or a pair of kitchen shears for tasks like spatchcocking a chicken).  I am not in any rush on this, but would like to take advantage of some of the deals that theoretically will be appearing for Black Friday, so any recommendations from the larger community would be greatly appreciated!

1. Style? - Western.  I know that this subreddit really advocates for a Japanese knife, and I think that is something that will be added to the collection/repertoire down the line, but for what I want out of a knife, it feels like the western/German style will be much better as a workhorse.
2. Steel?  - Stainless.  
3. Handle? - Probably western, but am more open to the alternative here.
4. Grip? - Pinch.  Developed a bad habit of using the handle grip on cheaper knives in the past, trying to grow out of that.  
5. Length? - 210 mm; but could be talked into something longer.
6. Uses? - Everyday usage.  Looking for a workhorse.
7. Care? - Any of the three.  There is a local paid service in town that does exceptional work and offers a great rate.  Have used him in the past, but will eventually transition into doing the honing work myself.  
8. Budget? Somewhere in the $100-$150 range, wouldn't object to something a bit higher but would like to stay away from the $200+ range for now.

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

* Want to be able to upgrade it over the next several years

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* The see through ones are cool but not necessary. Just want it to be big enough to add or change parts in the future.

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

* no I’ll figure that out

&gt; Since rtx gpu’s are impossible to get reasonably these days I’ve been researching comparable cards. Found the rx 5700 xt. Is this comparable and good for the next couple years?

2022-03-21 16:21:50 : VENDER LIVROS É UM DOS TRABALHO MAIS SIGNIFICANTES EM UMA ÉPOCA DE OBSCURANTISMO. : Afteroui : https://www.reddit.com/r/Livros/comments/tjflyd/vender_livros_é_um_dos_trabalho_mais/ Olá amigos do Cat Reddit; 

&amp;#x200B;

Gostaria de vir compartilhar um pensamento que venho tendo nessas últimas semanas. 

“O incentivo à leitura nunca foi tão importante em comparação as décadas anteriores.”

Nunca foi tão difícil ser brasileiro: inflação que supera 2 dígitos, governo federal que não liga pra educação da população e alto nível de desemprego. 

Diante desse cenário preocupante, digo que tenho muito orgulho do meu trabalho, exercendo ele vejo uma mudança real em como a população está cada vez mais interessada e curiosa na busca de desenvolvimento pessoal. Vejo significado e propósito na minha vida exercendo minha profissão. Espalho conhecimento por um preço bastante acessível em comparação a outras livrarias. 

Além disso, vocês me ajudam muito quando compram um livro. A cada dia estou mais perto da quantia necessária para começar meu mestrado em Coimbra. 

Obrigados a todos que vêm me apoiando e que seguem minha jornada.

&amp;#x200B;

Grande abraço a todos. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *2022-03-21 16:21:50 : VENDER LIVROS É UM DOS TRABALHO MAIS SIGNIFICANTES EM UMA ÉPOCA DE OBSCURANTISMO. : Afteroui : https://www.reddit.com/r/Livros/comments/tjflyd/vender_livros_é_um_dos_trabalho_mais/ Olá amigos do Cat Reddit;
