2020-10-29 16:12:22 : Guilt, shame and trauma : lueyforthethrone : https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/jkcyx2/guilt_shame_and_trauma/

My partner died by suicide in July. He was my first and only love of almost 9 years. He was 28 and I’m 29. The last interactions we had that day, were an argument. The last texts I sent him, the last words I spoke, and I even wrote an unkind hand written note that day because we were arguing the whole day. All of it was mean and I was drunk and I can’t remember exactly what I said. He ended his life while I was home playing with the dog in the kitchen of our apartment. I was playing with her to cheer up, sober up and get ready to forgive and talk to him....but I was too late and I found him in our bedroom. He didn’t die immediately, but he officially passed away a week later in the hospital. I am so destroyed. Not only was it a suicide, but our last interactions of our loving relationship were unkind. I see lots of posts of people looking back at their last texts saying they love each other. Ours were unkind and I have to live with it. He’s gone, my partner of 9 years, my soulmate. I had to move out of our apartment because I couldn’t stay in the place he ended his life. Now I’m back home in my childhood room with family that doesn’t get it.

My siblings don’t ask how I am, even though I only stay in my room and sleep most of the day, my cousins don’t and my friends might check in once a week if I’m lucky. This happened in July, why the fuck do people think I’m ok now, if ever? I witnessed his suicide and I had to walk away from the life we built for 9 years. Nobody gets it and I kind of hate everyone. Nobody I know knows partner loss, much less a suicide, much less one you witnessed. No one understands losing the one and only home you had with your love because they did the deed there. And no one understands the crippling loneliness I now feel. His friends don’t text me anymore, but some post of social media about him. I just don’t understand how people don’t ask how I am. I lost my half, and there is a reason they’re called your half. Our lives were meshed together and we lived parallel to each other. Everyday I talked to him, and almost everyday I saw him. The last 3 years I saw his face everyday. The only person who cared this deeply about me is gone because he couldn’t take this world anymore, and u don’t remember what I said but it didn’t help. And now it feels like I fucking deserve this loneliness, despair and depression. What a miserable existence
